# Assistive Computing with Eye-tracking

The project aim was to create an interface which could be navigated upon using the eyes' movements alone.
The project was concerned towards enabling people with complete body paralysis give a tool of communication at a low cost. 

Software used : Matlab for image processing
                HTML/CSS for front end creation
(Proposed scripting language : Python)

The project uses the vision toolbox in matlab for facial feature and eye detection. Thus Viola-Jones Algorithm was used to detect the facial features.
