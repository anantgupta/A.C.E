The ip file contains the code to change the grayscale image to a binary image. The algorithm is limited by the Viola Jones algorithm's 
efficiency.
Run the ACM matlab file where the ip file is copied. 

Future plan of action:
Edit the code to include image file reading instead of webcam. Sample image provided.
Use X and y axis to map the movement of black region by seeing the concenration of nodes having value 255. We track the value of x axis 
with respect to the y axis and according move the options on the front end. 
Use python as a scripting language to connect the matlab backend with html/css front-end
